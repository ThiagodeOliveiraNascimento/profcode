            <br>
            Tell me somethin', girl<br>
            Are you happy in this modern world?<br>
            Or do you need more?<br>
            Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?<br>
            <br>
            I'm falling<br>
            In all the good times I find myself<br>
            Longin' for change<br>
            And in the bad times I fear myself<br>
            <br>
            Tell me something, boy<br>
            Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?<br>
            Or do you need more?<br>
            Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?<br>
            <br>
            I'm falling<br>
            In all the good times I find myself<br>
            Longing for a change<br>
            And in the bad times I fear myself<br>
            <br>
            I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in<br>
            I'll never meet the ground<br>
            Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us<br>
            We're far from the shallow now<br>
            <br>
            In the sha-ha, sha-hallow<br>
            In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low<br>
            In the sha-ha, sha-hallow<br>
            We're far from the shallow now<br>
            <br>
            Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
            Whoa<br>
            <br>
            I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in<br>
            I'll never meet the ground<br>
            Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us<br>
            We're far from the shallow now<br>
            <br>
            In the sha-ha, shallow<br>
            In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low<br>
            In the sha-ha, shallow<br>
            We're far from the shallow now<br>

            <h1>Hallelujah - Rufus Wainwright</h1>
            Now I've heard there was a secret chord<br>
            That David played, and it pleased the Lord<br>
            But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
            It goes like this<br>
            The fourth, the fifth<br>
            The minor fall, the major lift<br>
            The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Your faith was strong but you needed proof<br>
            You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
            Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you<br>
            She tied you to a kitchen chair<br>
            She broke your throne, and she cut your hair<br>
            And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Maybe I have been here before<br>
            I know this room I, I've walked this floor<br>
            I used to live alone before I knew you<br>
            I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br>
            Love is not a victory march<br>
            It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
            There was I time you let me know<br>
            What's really going on below<br>
            But now you never show it to me do you<br>
            And rem<br>

            <h1>Heaven - Bryan Adams</h1>
            <br>
            Oh, thinking about our younger years<br>
            There was only you and me<br>
            We were young and wild and free<br>
            <br>
            Now nothing can take you away from me<br>
            We've been down that road before<br>
            But that's over now<br>
            You keep me coming back for more<br>
            <br>
            Baby, you're all that I want<br>
            When you're lying here in my arms<br>
            I'm finding it hard to believe<br>
            We're in heaven<br>
            <br>
            And love is all that I need<br>
            And I found it there in your heart<br>
            It isn't too hard to see<br>
            We're in heaven<br>
            <br>
            Oh, once in your life you find someone<br>
            Who will turn your world around<br>
            Bring you up when you're feeling down<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, nothing could change what you mean to me<br>
            Oh, there's lots that I could say<br>
            But just hold me now<br>
            'Cause our love will light the way<br>
            <br>
            And baby you're all that I want<br>
            When you're lying here in my arms<br>
            I'm finding it hard to believe<br>
            We're in heaven<br>
            <br>
            Yeah, love is all that I need<br>
            And I found it there in your heart<br>
            It isn't too hard to see<br>
            We're in heaven<br>
            Yeah<br>
            <br>
            I've been waiting for so long<br>
            For something to arrive<br>
            For love to come along<br>
            <br>
            Now our dreams are coming true<br>
            Through the good times and the bad<br>
            Yeah, I'll be standing there by you, oh<br>
            <br>
            And baby you're all that I want<br>
            When you're lying here in my arms<br>
            I'm finding it hard to believe<br>
            We're in heaven<br>
            <br>
            And love is all that I need<br>
            And I found it there in your heart<br>
            It isn't too hard to see<br>
            We're in heaven, heaven, woah<br>
            <br>
            You're all that I want<br>
            You're all that I need<br>
